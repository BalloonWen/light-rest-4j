As light-rest-4j is the first framework supported, we have more Restful examples
than any other style of microserivces. All rest examples can be found at https://github.com/networknt/light-example-4j/tree/master/rest

Most example applications consist multiple services and only petstore is a single service
which is described in [getting started](https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/getting-started/)

The rest of examples are used in [tutorial](https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/tutorial/)
and you can follow them step by step into the details.
