There are so many tools that help us to build restful microservices and here is a small list.

* [Swagger Editor](https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/tool/swagger-editor/) is used to create and update swagger specifications.

* [Swagger CLI](https://networknt.github.io/light-rest-4j/tool/swagger-cli/) to validate, merge and convert swagger specification files.
